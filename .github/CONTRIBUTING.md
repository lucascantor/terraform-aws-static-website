# Contributing Workflow

Hereâ€™s to propose a change to this repo:

1. [Create a branch][branch] for the change you intend to make.
1. Make your changes to your branch.
1. [Send a pull request][pr] from your branch to the `main` branch.
1. Your pull request will be assigned to this repo's [codeowners][codeowners] automatically.

[Using the web-based interface to make changes][editing] is fine too, and will help you
by automatically prompting you to create a branch and send a pull request too.
